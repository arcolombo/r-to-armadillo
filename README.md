# R To Armadillo
R is an amazing language to explore and communicate statistics with. However, when we care about attain results quickly, R's primary weakness is shown: speed. The objective of this repository is to strengthen this weakness by providing high performing  R base functions within armadillo (and potentially eigen). Futhermore, as the code is written within C++, the code is able to be ported to different platforms at ease. Lastly, an additional benefit of this project is a repository containing programming examples by field.

Feel free to use the functions available within the repository.

Also, feel free to submit translations or new code of R functions via a pull request.

# Project Details
The functions written here act either as a means to replicate existing R functionality within armadillo or as a helpful interface to armadillo's code. These functions are meant to be easily included within existing code bases with minimal dependencies.
